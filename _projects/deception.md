Coursework completed for a second-year Team Project module. Worked in a team of 10 to produce a web-based multiplayer game using Node.js and the Phaser HTML5 game framework.

## Description

Social deduction online multiplayer game (in the style of Among Us). Game includes chat functionality and a voting system.

## Technology

- [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) - HTML5 game framework for JavaScript
- Backend uses Node.js, with [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) for networking.
- Linting using [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/)
- Deployed using Heroku

## Reflection

This project was a great learning experience for me.

I gained experience in the project lifecycle, and monitoring the progress of the team from initial setup right through to submission/release.

While I gained much experience with Node.js & self taught Phaser, the most valuable lessons I learnt were in terms of teamwork and time management.

I also learned to use project management tools like Jira with a Kanban board, and took a leadership role to split tasks into more approachable user stories for the team.

I mentored other team members through sharing knowledge of version control, Node.js and agile development, and led paired programming sessions with team members.
