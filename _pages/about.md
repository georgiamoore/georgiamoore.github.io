Hey! Iâ€™m Georgia. I'm a final year BSc Computer Science student at Aston University, Birmingham. Iâ€™ll be joining Softwire as a software developer once I graduate in 2023. ðŸ’™

In 2020-2021, I was the Events Manager for the [Aston Computer Science Society](https://astoncss.com/), and I was also on the organisational team for [AstonHack6](https://astonhack.co.uk/), Aston University's very own hackathon. We won Event of the Year! ðŸŽ‰

I love to take part in outreach events, and I've previously delivered talks to students from Aston University, Birmingham City University and the University of Nottingham as part of my placement at Kainos.
