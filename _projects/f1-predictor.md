Submission for HackTheMidlands5

## Description

A small Python program intended to generate F1 qualifying & race results, based on historic data.

## Technology

- Python 3
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Ergast F1 dataset](https://ergast.com/mrd/)
- Lots of coffee


## Reflection

I'd never used pandas before, and hadn't used Python since I did my GCSEs - so getting up to speed with those two took a large part of the hackathon!

Ideally I'd like to remake this - as it is right now the program doesn't do much actual analysis as I wasn't familiar with pandas.

I now have further knowledge through the [Kainos Engineering Academy](/portfolio/engineering-academy) and my [freeCodeCamp](/portfolio/freeCodeCamp) certifications, so I could make the program a little more robust in future.
