## Description

Completed Kainos' 7-week Engineering Academy.  

## Technology

- Relational database fundamentals with MySQL
- Java & version control
- Web development
  - JavaScript / Node.js
  - HTML / CSS
  - Nunjucks templating using GOV.UK design system
- Testing with JUnit, JMeter, Selenium and Cucumber.
- Other sessions on business/soft skills

## Projects

The first section of the academy included 3 different day-long group projects, demonstrating knowledge gained of MySQL, Java and JavaScript, followed by presentations to mentors and other academy members.

The final part of the academy involved a 3-week Agile Scrum project in a group of 5:

- Created a RESTful API backend (Java, Dropwizard, MySQL, Swagger) and a web-based frontend (Node.js, Nunjucks, Express), including authentication
- Contributed to all parts of the project but focused on backend & authentication implementation, including refactoring backend code to simplify logic & testing
- Gained experience in agile processes such as ticket estimation and backlog prioritisation
- Experienced different forms of testing using JUnit, Jest, Cypress and Axe
- Set up continuous integration using Travis, which also ensured code styles remained consistent using CheckStyle and ESLint
